# Calendar connected to Scheduler with priorities and Notes

## Priorities:

> 'High', 'Medium' and 'Low' priority will be constantly changing while the deadline of event is closing.
> That means i.e. 'Low' priority event can become 'Medium' priority event if deadline is 1 day apart
>
> 'No' priority will be static, it will not become 'Low', 'Medium' nor 'High' priority while deadline of event is approaching
>
> - 'High' priority is '#8B0B0B' color
> - 'Medium' priority is '#FECD1E' color
> - 'Low' priority is '#288BA8' color
> - 'No' priority is '#67B826' color
